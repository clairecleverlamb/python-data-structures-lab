# Exercise 1: List and Indexing
#
# Create a list named students containing at least three student names (strings).
# Assign the second student’s name to a variable named first_student.
# Assign the last student’s name to a variable named last_student.

def manage_students():
    students = ['Alex', 'Bryan', 'Dan', 'Marissa']
    first_student = students[1]
    last_student = students[-1]
    return first_student, last_student

print('Exercise 1:', manage_students())


# Exercise 2: Loop and String Concatenation
#
# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Create a variable named meal and assign an empty string to it.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the strings in foods and append each string to meal.

def combine_foods():
    foods = ('apple', 'chocolate', 'strawberry', 'banana')
    meal = ""
    for food in foods:
        meal += " " + food
    return meal

print('Exercise 2:', combine_foods())


# Exercise 3: Slicing Tuples
#
# Using the slice operator, assign a new tuple containing only the last two food strings in the foods to a variable named last_two_foods.

def slice_foods():
    foods = ('apple', 'chocolate', 'strawberry', 'banana')
    sub_foods = (foods[-2], foods[-1])
    return sub_foods
print('Exercise 3:', slice_foods())


# Exercise 4: Dictionaries and String Formatting
#
# Create a dictionary named home_town containing the keys of city, state, and population.
# Using the home_town dictionary, assign to a variable named home_town_message a string with this format: “I was born in <city>, <state> - population of <population>”

def hometown_info():
    home_town = {
        'city': 'Alameda',
        'state': 'California',
        'population' : 20000
    }
    home_town_message = f"I was born in {home_town['city']}, {home_town['state']} - population of {home_town['population']}."
    return home_town_message

print('Exercise 4:', hometown_info())



# Exercise 5: Iterating Over Dictionary Items
#
# Define an empty list named home_town_items.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the key: value pairs in the home_town dictionary and append a string with the following format to home_town_items: "<key> = <value>"



def list_home_town_items():
    home_town = {
        'city': 'Alameda',
        'state': 'California',
        'population' : 20000
    }
    home_town_items = []
    for key, value in home_town.items():
        home_town_items.append(f'{key} = {value}')
    return home_town_items

print('Exercise 5:', list_home_town_items())


# Exercise 6: Celebrate Students
#
# Using the list of students and a list comprehension, assign to a variable named awesome_students a new list containing strings.
# For example: ["Tina is awesome!", "Fred is awesome!", "Wilma is awesome!"]

def create_awesome_students():
    students = ['Alex', 'Bryan', 'Dan', 'Marissa']
    awesome_students = [ f"{student} is awesome!" for student in students]
    return awesome_students
print('Exercise 6:', create_awesome_students())



# Exercise 7: Filter Foods
#
# Assign to a variable named foods_with_an_a the result of list comprehension that filters the foods tuple to only include food strings that contain the letter 'a'.
# For example, if foods is a tuple of ('Taco', 'Burrito', 'Sandwich'), foods_with_an_a would be a list equal to ['Taco', 'Sandwich']

def filter_foods_with_a():
    foods = ('apple', 'chocolate', 'strawberry', 'banana')
    foods_with_an_a = [food for food in foods if 'a' in food]
    return foods_with_an_a
